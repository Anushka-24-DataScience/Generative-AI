A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. \\\"A patient at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has tested negative for Ebola,\\\" the press release said. \\\"The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands.\\\" Meanwhile, a health care worker who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London. The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there. 'Extremely low' risk . UK authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with Cafferkey. The Scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same London Heathrow-to-Glasgow flight as Cafferkey. British Airways said it was working closely with health authorities in England and Scotland and would help with any information needed. \\\"The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low,\\\" the airline said. Ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. The deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN that British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case. \\\"They agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and, although the risk to the general population remained low, all measures would be taken to protect public health.\\\" Possible case . Another suspected Ebola case is being tested in southwest England at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, health officials said. \\\"We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation, following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients,\\\" said a joint statement from the hospital and Public Health England, a government agency. According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. As of December 24, at least 7,693 people had died in the current Ebola outbreak, centered in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said. There have been at least 19,695 cases.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- Scientifically, can happiness be an advantage? Some people think if you are happy, you are blind to reality. But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive . Now that there is research validity to these claims, the working world is starting to take notice. In January, I wrote the cover story for the Harvard Business Review magazine on \\\"Happiness Leads to Profits.\\\" Based on my article called \\\"Positive Intelligence\\\" and my research in The Happiness Advantage, I outlined our researched conclusion: the single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce. A decade of research in the business world proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality-of-life improvements. Given the unprecedented level of unhappiness at companies and the direct link between happiness and business outcomes, the question is NOT whether happiness should matter to companies. Given this research, it clearly should. The first question is: What can I do in my own life to reap the advantage of happiness? See also: Ambition could make you rich, but not happy . Training your brain to be positive at work is just like training your muscles at the gym. Sounds simple, right? Well, think about how easy it is to make yourself go to the gym. The key with any new resolution is to make it a habit. New research on neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to change even as an adult -- reveals that moderate actions can rewire the brain as you create \\\"life habits.\\\" In The Happiness Advantage, I challenge readers to do one brief positive exercise every day for 21 days. Only through behavioral change can information become transformation. \\u2022 Write down three new things you are grateful for each day; . \\u2022 Write for two minutes a day describing one positive experience you had over the past 24 hours; . \\u2022 Exercise for 10 minutes a day; . \\u2022 Meditate for two minutes, focusing on your breath going in and out; . \\u2022 Write one quick email first thing in the morning thanking or praising someone in your social support network (family member, friend, old teacher). But does it work? In the midst of the worst tax season in history I did a three-hour intervention at auditing and tax accounting firm KPMG, describing how to reap the happiness advantage by creating one of these positive habits. Four months later, there was a 24% improvement in job and life satisfaction. Not only is change possible, this is one of the first long-term ROI (return on investment) studies proving that happiness leads to long-term quantifiable positive change. In a study I performed on 1,600 Harvard students in 2007, I found that there was a 0.7 correlation between perceived social support and happiness. This is higher than the connection between smoking and cancer. So if in the modern world we give up our social networks to work away from friends and follow celebrities on Twitter, we are trading off with our happiness and health. Following up, I switched around the questions and asked how much social support employees provided (instead of received). The results were off the charts. Those high on provision of social support are 10 times more engaged at work and have a 40% higher likelihood of promotion over the next four years. In other words, giving at the office gets you more than receiving. The greatest cultural myth in modern society is that we cannot change.

Towards the end of his three years at the Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy, Kitchener was given a tough time by Sturridge in a junior game against Coventry. Kitchener was 14 at the time and the experience helped him to decide that he should turn his attention to the oval ball. Leicester\\u2019s Graham Kitchener charges forward against Harlequins earlier this month . Kitchener is pushing for a Six Nations call-up after an impressive start to the season .

Danny Cipriani \\u2013 Sale \\u2013 QPR \\u2013 left back . Mark Cueto \\u2013 Sale \\u2013 Crewe Alexandra \\u2013 left wing . Marland Yarde \\u2013 Harlequins \\u2013 QPR \\u2013 centre midfield .

David Strettle \\u2013 Saracens \\u2013 Manchester City \\u2013 right wing . Dom Barrow - Newcastle - Manchester United \\u2013 centre half . The decision paid off and the 6ft 6in and 19st forward is currently knocking on the door for a Six Nations call-up. However, there was a time when he seemed more likely to pursue a career as a centre half, rather than a second-row. \\u2018I flirted with football for a couple of years,\\u2019 said Kitchener.\\u00a0\\u2018At Wolves, we went on tour and played against teams like Arsenal and Manchester United. \\u2018I played against Sturridge when I was 14. I was marking him \\u2014 or trying to! As you\\u2019d expect, he wasn\\u2019t a bad player and was a pretty big unit back in the day. 'He gave a few of us the runaround, but at the time you didn\\u2019t really appreciate what he would go on to achieve.\\u2019 Sturridge now earns around \\u00a3150,000 a week, while salaries in rugby are a relative drop in the ocean. But Kitchener recognised the slim chances involved with pursuing football\\u2019s mega-bucks and instead completed his A-levels and signed for Worcester Warriors. Daniel Sturridge gave Kitchener the runaround during an academy game between Wolves and Coventry . Out of his academy age-group at Wolves, only Elliott Bennett went on to play in the Premier League as most failed to make the cut in an extremely competitive market. But doors to the senior ranks opened quickly when Kitchener turned his focus to rugby. \\u2018I realised I was a bit more suited to the rugby environment with my size and that kind of thing,\\u2019 said Kitchener. \\u2018There were a few transferable skills \\u2014 we focused a lot on agility and speed over a short distance, which always helps. Kitchener has no regrets turning his back on football to pursue a career in rugby . \\u2018We would train about three times a week at Wolves \\u2014 it was tough, but not a lot of people made it so I didn\\u2019t see a massive future in the game.\\u2019 Kitchener is not the only ex-footballer to make the switch. As with a hard-hitting forward, natural size and strength is a valuable asset for a goalkeeper or defender. Jordan Crane and Joe Launchbury are both former keepers who went on to play in the pack, while Dom Barrow and Kitchener were centre halves who joined rugby\\u2019s heavies in the tight-five. Physicality is not such an important asset in the back-line and some of England Rugby\\u2019s most skilful playmakers have backgrounds as wing backs, midfielders and strikers. Saracens full back Alex Goode is one of the most intelligent readers of the game \\u2014 previously he conducted play as a central midfielder for Ipswich Town. Harlequins star Danny Care used to play as a strike for Sheffield Wednesday before switching to rugby . Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care is known for his ability to snipe around the fringes of the breakdown and he used to run lines through the defence as a nippy striker for Sheffield Wednesday. Similarly, Danny Cipriani, Marland Yarde, David Strettle and Mark Cueto all played further up the field in football before becoming astute backs in rugby. At Welford Road, Kitchener is often seen breaking clear of defenders, in a way you would not expect from a man of his size. His footwork and quick change of balance helps keep defenders guessing and his form has earned him a consistent run in Leicester\\u2019s starting XV. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill has rotated his squad for tonight\\u2019s Champions Cup tie against Scarlets, with Kitchener on the bench alongside England hooker Tom Youngs and Wales hopeful Owen Williams. Kitchener is aiming high and has targeted a first cap for England . But Kitchener has international ambitions. After playing for the Saxons and being called up as injury cover for the November Tests, he is now hoping to go one better and win his first cap. \\u2018I loved being involved in the autumn and I\\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\\u2019t thinking about it,\\u2019 said Kitchener. \\u2018The reality is there are a lot of quality second-rows around England at the moment, so I just have to see how it goes.\\u2019\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Woman in the Scottish Highlands tests negative for Ebola, government says .\\nA health care worker diagnosed with the virus is moved to a London hospital .\\nShe was working with Save the Children in Sierra Leone as a volunteer nurse .\\nA third suspected Ebola case is being tested in the southwest of England, officials say .\",\n          \"The greatest advantage in the economy is a happy workforce, argues Shawn Achor .\\nAchor says if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an advantage .\\nHe explains how to train your brain to be positive at work .\",\n          \"Graham Kitchener played against footballer Daniel Sturridge at youth level .\\nLeicester Tigers lock admits England striker gave him the runaround .\\nKitchener decided to quit football to focus his efforts on rugby instead .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"###Human: Summarize this following article: A woman in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for Ebola, the Scottish government said Tuesday.

'He gave a few of us the runaround, but at the time you didn\\u2019t really appreciate what he would go on to achieve.\\u2019 Sturridge now earns around \\u00a3150,000 a week, while salaries in rugby are a relative drop in the ocean. But Kitchener recognised the slim chances involved with pursuing football\\u2019s mega-bucks and instead completed his A-levels and signed for Worcester Warriors. Daniel Sturridge gave Kitchener the runaround during an academy game between Wolves and Coventry . Out of his academy age-group at Wolves, only Elliott Bennett went on to play in the Premier League as most failed to make the cut in an extremely competitive market. But doors to the senior ranks opened quickly when Kitchener turned his focus to rugby. \\u2018I realised I was a bit more suited to the rugby environment with my size and that kind of thing,\\u2019 said Kitchener. \\u2018There were a few transferable skills \\u2014 we focused a lot on agility and speed over a short distance, which always helps. Kitchener has no regrets turning his back on football to pursue a career in rugby . \\u2018We would train about three times a week at Wolves \\u2014 it was tough, but not a lot of people made it so I didn\\u2019t see a massive future in the game.\\u2019 Kitchener is not the only ex-footballer to make the switch. As with a hard-hitting forward, natural size and strength is a valuable asset for a goalkeeper or defender. Jordan Crane and Joe Launchbury are both former keepers who went on to play in the pack, while Dom Barrow and Kitchener were centre halves who joined rugby\\u2019s heavies in the tight-five. Physicality is not such an important asset in the back-line and some of England Rugby\\u2019s most skilful playmakers have backgrounds as wing backs, midfielders and strikers. Saracens full back Alex Goode is one of the most intelligent readers of the game \\u2014 previously he conducted play as a central midfielder for Ipswich Town. Harlequins star Danny Care used to play as a strike for Sheffield Wednesday before switching to rugby . Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care is known for his ability to snipe around the fringes of the breakdown and he used to run lines through the defence as a nippy striker for Sheffield Wednesday. Similarly, Danny Cipriani, Marland Yarde, David Strettle and Mark Cueto all played further up the field in football before becoming astute backs in rugby. At Welford Road, Kitchener is often seen breaking clear of defenders, in a way you would not expect from a man of his size. His footwork and quick change of balance helps keep defenders guessing and his form has earned him a consistent run in Leicester\\u2019s starting XV. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill has rotated his squad for tonight\\u2019s Champions Cup tie against Scarlets, with Kitchener on the bench alongside England hooker Tom Youngs and Wales hopeful Owen Williams. Kitchener is aiming high and has targeted a first cap for England . But Kitchener has international ambitions. After playing for the Saxons and being called up as injury cover for the November Tests, he is now hoping to go one better and win his first cap. \\u2018I loved being involved in the autumn and I\\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\\u2019t thinking about it,\\u2019 said Kitchener. \\u2018The reality is there are a lot of quality second-rows around England at the moment, so I just have to see how it goes.\\u2019\\n###Assistant: Graham Kitchener played against footballer Daniel Sturridge at youth level .\\nLeicester Tigers lock admits England striker gave him the runaround .\\nKitchener decided to quit football to focus his efforts on rugby instead .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. \\\"A patient at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has tested negative for Ebola,\\\" the press release said. \\\"The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands.\\\" Meanwhile, a health care worker who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London. The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there. 'Extremely low' risk . UK authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with Cafferkey. The Scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same London Heathrow-to-Glasgow flight as Cafferkey.

Ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. The deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN that British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case. \\\"They agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and, although the risk to the general population remained low, all measures would be taken to protect public health.\\\" Possible case . Another suspected Ebola case is being tested in southwest England at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, health officials said. \\\"We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation, following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients,\\\" said a joint statement from the hospital and Public Health England, a government agency. According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home.

But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive . Now that there is research validity to these claims, the working world is starting to take notice. In January, I wrote the cover story for the Harvard Business Review magazine on \\\"Happiness Leads to Profits.\\\" Based on my article called \\\"Positive Intelligence\\\" and my research in The Happiness Advantage, I outlined our researched conclusion: the single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce. A decade of research in the business world proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality-of-life improvements. Given the unprecedented level of unhappiness at companies and the direct link between happiness and business outcomes, the question is NOT whether happiness should matter to companies. Given this research, it clearly should. The first question is: What can I do in my own life to reap the advantage of happiness? See also: Ambition could make you rich, but not happy . Training your brain to be positive at work is just like training your muscles at the gym. Sounds simple, right? Well, think about how easy it is to make yourself go to the gym. The key with any new resolution is to make it a habit. New research on neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to change even as an adult -- reveals that moderate actions can rewire the brain as you create \\\"life habits.\\\" In The Happiness Advantage, I challenge readers to do one brief positive exercise every day for 21 days. Only through behavioral change can information become transformation. \\u2022 Write down three new things you are grateful for each day; . \\u2022 Write for two minutes a day describing one positive experience you had over the past 24 hours; . \\u2022 Exercise for 10 minutes a day; . \\u2022 Meditate for two minutes, focusing on your breath going in and out; . \\u2022 Write one quick email first thing in the morning thanking or praising someone in your social support network (family member, friend, old teacher). But does it work? In the midst of the worst tax season in history I did a three-hour intervention at auditing and tax accounting firm KPMG, describing how to reap the happiness advantage by creating one of these positive habits. Four months later, there was a 24% improvement in job and life satisfaction. Not only is change possible, this is one of the first long-term ROI (return on investment) studies proving that happiness leads to long-term quantifiable positive change. In a study I performed on 1,600 Harvard students in 2007, I found that there was a 0.7 correlation between perceived social support and happiness. This is higher than the connection between smoking and cancer. So if in the modern world we give up our social networks to work away from friends and follow celebrities on Twitter, we are trading off with our happiness and health. Following up, I switched around the questions and asked how much social support employees provided (instead of received). The results were off the charts. Those high on provision of social support are 10 times more engaged at work and have a 40% higher likelihood of promotion over the next four years. In other words, giving at the office gets you more than receiving. The greatest cultural myth in modern society is that we cannot change. My research proves that you can not only become more positive, but if you prioritize happiness in the present, you can reap an extraordinary advantage.

The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there. 'Extremely low' risk .
